# Things to investigate

## Difficulty Scaling (LevelSensor)
- How scaling works for amiibo weapons. What determines the drop table list that gets used?

## Final battle logic (actors and GameDataMgr)
- What game data exactly is transferred when the game is beaten

## Blood Moon (GameDataMgr)
- The Blood Moon mechanism

## Debug stuff
~~What happens if the ROM type is set to Show_2017_1st or RID_Demo?~~ The game crashes. Why?

Is it possible to get to the stage select screen on release versions?

## One-Hit Kill protection (player actor probably)
What are the conditions for one-hit kill protection to apply?

NoDeathDamageBase (in Link's bgparam) might be related.

Also worth noting that this is gone in Master Mode.
